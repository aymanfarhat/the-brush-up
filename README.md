# The Brushup
### Sharpening the saw with data structures and algorithm problems

A series of exercises on implementing common data structures and solving algorithm problems around them in Python. The main idea
behind this repository is to commit on regularly sharpening the saw and recieve feedback on that. 

Many exercises are inspired from:

- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/dp/098478280X/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_KkWmyb984ZN8W) (Highly recommended read)

## Setup Instructions

You need to have Python 3 installed. Then install the dependencies in your virtualenv via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Table of contents

Each directory contains exercises on each topic and a README file for more description and references. You can jump
to any topic you want by referring to the table of contents below.
